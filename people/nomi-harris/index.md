I am the program manager for the Mungall group. I have a masterâ€™s degree in computer science from MIT and a long history in bioinformatics, starting as a software developer and transitioning into scientific project management and communications. My involvement in the bioinformatics open source community includes chairing the annual [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/) and serving as a board member of the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://www.open-bio.org/).
