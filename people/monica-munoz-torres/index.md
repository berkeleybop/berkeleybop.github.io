Moni is the biocuration lead & a bioinformatics scientist at the Berkeley Bioinformatics Open-Source Projects group (BBOP) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where she offers evolutionary and biologically relevant perspectives to the development of genome annotation editing tools. She is a molecular biologist with a background in genomic resources production: in the lab, in library construction and analysis; and at the computer, in molecular evolution, genome annotation editing, functional annotation, etc. She is currently the Project Manager for [Apollo - a web-based annotation editor](http://genomearchitect.org/) designed to support community-based curation of genomes - and manager for outreach and user advocacy for the [Gene Ontology Consortium](http://geneontology.org/).

Moni is currently the Chair of the [International Society for Biocuration (ISB)](http://biocuration.org/), and she leads the Community Curation group within the global initiative to sequence and annotate the genomes of 5,000 arthropods [(i5K Initiative)](http://i5k.github.io/). Although she now moves in a species-agnostic environment for curation of non-model organisms, much of her previous work was focused on Arthropods, particularly species of Hymenoptera -- thus her unapologetic insect bias.
