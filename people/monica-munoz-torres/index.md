Moni is a bioinformatics scientist and the biocuration lead at the Berkeley Bioinformatics Open-Source Projects group (BBOP) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where she offers evolutionary and biologically relevant perspectives to the development of genome annotation editing tools. She is a molecular biologist with a background in genomic resources production: in the lab, in library construction and analysis; and at the computer, in molecular evolution, genome annotation editing, functional annotation, etc. She is currently part of the development team for Apollo - a web-based annotation editor designed to support community-based curation of genomes - and a member of the Gene Ontology Consortium.

Moni leads the Community Curation group within the global initiative to sequence and annotate the genomes of 5,000 arthropods (i5K Initiative), and is a member of the Executive Committee of the International Society for Biocuration (ISB). Although she now moves in a species-agnostic environment for curation of non-model organisms, much of her previous work was focused on Arthropods, particularly species of Hymenoptera and the Hymenoptera Genome Database -- thus her unapologetic insect bias.
