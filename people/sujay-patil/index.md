I started as a software developer with the BBOP team in August 2021. I got my Bachelor's degree from [VIT University](https://vit.ac.in/), *India* in Computer Science and Engineering, so I'm one of those Bioinformatics enthusiasts who started as a Computer Engineer. After getting undergrad and working as a software developer for a year, I decided to 
pursue my Master's degree in Biomedical Informatics and Bioinformatics from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), *Los Angeles*. During the course of my Master's and for a little while after, I worked as a Software Developer on the NIH funded the [All of Us Research Program](https://allofus.nih.gov/) project (at *USC*), and as a Bioinformatics Engineer on the NCI funded [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://humantumoratlas.org/), or HTAN project (at *Sage Bionetworks*). At BBOP, I'm working to contribute to a variety of NIH and DOE funded projects including the [Gene Ontology](http://berkeleybop.org/project/gene-ontology/) (GO), the [Monarch Initiative](http://berkeleybop.org/project/monarch/), and the [Center for Cancer Data Harmonization](http://berkeleybop.org/project/ccdh/) (CCDH).
