I joined BBOP as a software developer in March 2022. My educational background is in electrical engineering, but most of my career has been in database and web development for biological and environmental informatics applications. At BBOP I work on the [NMDC](/project/nmdc/) and [Phenomics First](/project/phenomics-first/) projects.
