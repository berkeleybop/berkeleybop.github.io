I joined BBOP in April 2019. I am a computational biologist with an interest in integrating bioinformatics data to facilitate discovery, especially with respect to human disease. I am a lead on the group's new [KG-COVID-19 project](/project/kg-covid-19). I also develop software for the Monarch Initiative and other projects.
