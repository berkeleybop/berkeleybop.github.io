I have experience in bioinformatics, knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, and web interface design.  Prior to joining BBOP, my research oriented around the intersection of crowdsourcing and the semantic web. My work for BBOP focuses on building GO-Causal Activity Models (GO-CAMs) from biological pathway resources such as Reactome.  In addition, I contribute to the software infrastructure that supports GO-CAM editing and use.
