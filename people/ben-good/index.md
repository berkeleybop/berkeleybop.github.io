I have experience in knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, and web interface design.
At Scripps I helped develop GeneWiki. My work for BBOP focuses on building congruent GO-Causal Activity Models (GO-CAMs) from pathway resources such as Reatome, Wiki-Pathways, Pathway Commons, and others.
