I joined BBOP in October 2020 as a software developer. I have a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering but have been a software developer most of my career. Currently I'm involved in many projects with the [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org). I've also contributed in projects relevant to [Knowledge-Graph-Hub](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub) , [Mapping Commons](https://github.com/mapping-commons), [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml) and [INCATools](https://github.com/INCATools).

Some of the fun projects I'm involved in:

 - [ontobot-change-agent](https://github.com/hrshdhgd/ontobot-change-agent): A GitHub bot for modifying ontology resources.
 - [curate-gpt](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/curate-gpt): CurateGPT is a prototype web application and framework for performing general purpose AI-guided curation and curation-related operations over collections of objects.
 - [semsimian](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/semsimian): Rust implementation of semantic similarity
 - [OAK](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-access-kit): Ontology Access Kit (OAK) is a python library & command line application for working with ontologies.
 - [SSSOM](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom-py): Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) is a TSV-based representation for ontology term mappings.
 - [kg-microbe](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-microbe): Knowledge graph development for microbial data.
 - [MONDO](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo): Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo) aims to harmonize disease definitions across the world.

I've also been involved in developing project templates via cookiecutters:

 - [monarch-project-template](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-project-template)
 - [kg-cookiecutter](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-cookiecutter)
 - [linkml-project-cookiecutter](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter)
