My background is in computational biology in the areas of functional genomics and systems biology, where I develop algorithms and machine learning methods, with a focus on bioontologies, knowledge graphs, large language models, and graph learning.
I lead a LBNL project to predict growth conditions for microbes using knowledge graphs [KG-Microbe](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-microbe) and graph learning, as well as the Datasheets for Datasets effort [Datasheets for Datasets](https://github.com/bridge2ai/data-sheets-schema/tree/main) and contribute to several BBOP projects including: [Bridge2AI]([/project/bridge2ai](https://bridge2ai.org/standards-core/#:~:text=The%20Bridge2AI%20Standards%20Core%20aims,across%20Bridge2AI%20Data%20Generation%20Projects.)https://bridge2ai.org/standards-core/#:~:text=The%20Bridge2AI%20Standards%20Core%20aims,across%20Bridge2AI%20Data%20Generation%20Projects), [KG-Hub]([/project/kg-hub](https://kghub.org/)), [KG-COVID-19](/project/kg-covid-19).
