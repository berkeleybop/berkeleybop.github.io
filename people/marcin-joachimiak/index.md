**Dr. Marcin P. Joachimiak** is a computational biologist working across functional genomics and systems biology, developing algorithms and machine-learning methods with a focus on **bioontologies**, **knowledge graphs**, **large language models**, and **graph learning**.

I lead the LBNL **[CultureBot](https://culturebotai.github.io/)** program (see **[CultureBotAI on GitHub](https://github.com/CultureBotAI)**) to predict **microbial growth conditions** using knowledge graphs and graph learning—most centrally the **[KG-Microbe knowledge graph](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-microbe)**. I also lead the D4D Working Group in the NIH Bridge2AI **[Datasheets for Datasets](https://github.com/bridge2ai/data-sheets-schema/tree/main)** effort and contribute to BBOP AI methods such as **[TALISMAN](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/talisman)** and **[OntoGPT](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ontogpt)**, as well as BBOP projects including **[Bridge2AI Standards Core](https://bridge2ai.org/standards-core/)**, **[KG-Hub](https://kghub.org/)**, and **[KG-COVID-19](/project/kg-covid-19)**.
