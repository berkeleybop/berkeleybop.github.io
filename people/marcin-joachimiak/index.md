My background is in computational biology in the areas of functional genomics and systems biology, where I develop algorithm and machine learning method development, with a focus on bioontologies, large language models, knowledge graphs, and graph learning.
I contribute to several BBOP projects, including [IDG2KG](/project/idg2kg) and [KG-COVID-19](/project/kg-covid-19).
