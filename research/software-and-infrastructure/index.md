We produce robust, modular software that is designed to be reused across multiple projects.

## Web Development

Our AmiGO ontology-based data browser is the official browser for the
[Gene Ontology](../project/gene-ontology) project, and has also been
adapted as the [Planteome](../project/planteome) browser.

AmiGO is constructed from a collection of javascript components, see
https://github.com/berkeleybop/ for details.
