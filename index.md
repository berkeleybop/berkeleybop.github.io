**Welcome!**


Berkeley Bioinformatics Open-source Projects (BBOP), located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is a group of scientific researchers and software engineers dedicated to developing tools and applying computational technologies to problems in biology and biomedicine.
Members of the group contribute to a number of large collaborative projects, including the [Gene Ontology](project/gene-ontology), [Monarch Initiative](project/monarch/), [NCATS Biomedical Data Translator](/project/ncats-translator), [OBO Foundry](project/obo-foundry), [Alliance for Genome Resources](project/agr), and the [National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC)](/project/nmdc).

Our group focuses on interoperable data, open science, and the development, use, and integration of ontologies into biological data analysis. We invite you to learn more about our projects, people, and [practices](best_practice).
