**Welcome!**


Berkeley Bioinformatics Open-source Projects (BBOP), located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is a group of scientific researchers and software engineers dedicated to developing tools and applying computational technologies to problems in biology in medicine. Members of the group contribute to a number of large collaborative projects, including the [Gene Ontology](project/gene-ontology), [OBO Foundry](project/obo-foundry), [Monarch Initiative](project/monarch/), [NCATS Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator), the [Alliance for Genome Resources](project/agr), and the [National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC)](https://microbiomedata.org/).

Our group focuses on the development, use, and integration of ontologies into biological data analysis. We invite you to learn more about our projects and people.
