**Welcome!**



Berkeley Bioinformatics Open-source Projects (BBOP), located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, is a diverse group of scientific researchers and software engineers dedicated to developing tools and applying computational technologies to solve biological problems. Members of the group contribute to a number of projects, including the [Gene Ontology](project/gene-ontology), [OBO Foundry](project/obo-foundry), [Monarch Initiative](project/monarch/), [NIH Data STAGE](https://www.nhlbidatastage.org/), [NCATS Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator), and the [Alliance for Genome Resources](project/agr).

Our group is focused on the development, use, and integration of ontologies into biological data analysis. We invite you to learn more about our projects and people.
