NEAT (Network Embedding All the Things) is a flexible pipeline for:

- Parsing a graph serialization
- Generating node and edge embeddings
- Training classifiers for link prediction and label expansion
- Making predictions
- Creating well formatted output and metrics for the predictions
- Doing all of the above reproducibly, with cloud compute (or locally, if preferred)
