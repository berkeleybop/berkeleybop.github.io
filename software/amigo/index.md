[AmiGO](http://amigo.geneontology.org) is the official tool for searching and browsing the Gene Ontology database. It allows you to explore a controlled vocabulary of terms covering biological concepts, and a large number of genes or gene products whose attributes have been annotated using GO terms.

Using AmiGO, you can:

 * Search for a gene or gene product, or a list of gene or gene products, and view the GO term associations
 * Perform a sequence identity BLAST search and view the GO term associations for the genes or proteins returned
 * Search for GO terms and view the genes or gene products they are annotated to
 * Browse the GO ontology and view terms

## Golr

Golr is the Solr index used by AmiGO. It has been adopted as the faceted search index for [Monarch](../../project/monarch)

## Team

The primary AmiGO developer is Seth Carbon
