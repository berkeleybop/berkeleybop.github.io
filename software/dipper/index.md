Dipper is a Python package that generates RDF triples from common scientific resources. It was used in [Monarch's](https://monarchinitiative.org/)'s data ingestion pipeline.
Dipper includes subpackages and modules to create graphical models of this data, including:

* Models for ternary associations and complex partonomies
* Graph utilities to create common relationships using a variety of ontologies
* Fetchers and Parsers that interface with remote databases and web services
