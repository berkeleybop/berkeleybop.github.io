The Biolink Model is a high level datamodel of biological entities (genes, diseases, phenotypes, pathways, individuals, substances, etc) and their associations.

One of the main uses of the model is to standardize types and relational structures in knowledge graphs (KGs), where the KG may be either a property graph or RDF.

(Talk about relationship wtih Biolink API and Biolink ML)
