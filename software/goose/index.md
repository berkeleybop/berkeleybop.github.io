Allows nearly arbitrary SQL to be executed over the BBOP or EBI mirror of the GO database. It includes query templates, highlighted output, and downloads.

The GO Database is a relational database external link housing both the Gene Ontology and the annotations of genes and gene products to terms in the GO. The advantage of housing both ontologies and annotations in a single database is that powerful queries can be performed over annotations using the ontology.
