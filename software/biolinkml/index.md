LinkML (formerly named BiolinkML, but it's not just for bio) is a general purpose modeling language that can be used with linked data, JSON, and other formalisms.

Models can be created in YAML, JSON or RDF. A variety of artefacts can be generated from the model, including ShEx, JSON-Schema, OWL, Python dataclasses, UML diagrams, Markdown pages for deployment in a GitHub pages site, and more.

LinkML is actively being used for the development and maintenance of the [Biolink Model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/).
