The Biolink Modeling Language (BiolinkML) is a general purpose modeling language that inherits principles from both 
the object-oriented world as well as the Web Ontology Language (OWL) world. 
Models are authored in YAML where you can enumerate classes, slots, types and schema definitions.

BiolinkML allows the generation of variety of artefacts such as,
- ShEx
- JSON Schema
- OWL
- Python dataclasses
- Java classes
- UML diagrams
- Graphviz 
- GraphQL schema
- GOlr schema
- Protobuf
- JSON-LD
- Markdown documentation

BiolinkML is actively being used for the development and maintenance of the [Biolink Model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/).
