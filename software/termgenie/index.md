TermGenie is a web application for ontology content generation. It generates new terms according to pre-defined templates, and uses OWL reasoners to place the term in the correct place in the ontology

Originally this was devolped for the GeneOntology, but TermGenie uses a generic approach applicable to many ontologies.
