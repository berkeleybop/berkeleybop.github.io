ROBOT (a recursive acronym for “ROBOT is an OBO Tool”) is an open source library and command-line tool for automating ontology development tasks.
It supports automation of a wide range of ontology development tasks, focusing on [Open Biomedical
Ontology (OBO)](http://obofoundry.org) conventions. ROBOT packages common high-level ontology development functionality into a convenient library, and makes it easy to configure, combine, and execute individual tasks in comprehensive, automated workflows. This helps ontology developers to efficiently create, maintain, and release high-quality ontologies, and helps guarantee that released ontologies are free of certain types of logical errors and conform to standard quality control checks.
