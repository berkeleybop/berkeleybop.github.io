#### Finding us

Depending on the day and scheduling, we may be at LBL Potter Street
(most likely) or UC Berkeley (occasionally).

#### LBL Potter Street

Our location at 717 Potter Street, within the Environmental Genomics & Systems Biology (EBSG) group, is fairly easy to get to, near I80. Car is the easiest method to get here, but the Potter Street shuttle from the Downtown Berkeley BART station is also a possibility, as well as bike. If you manage to get into the building without one of us, please sign in at the main desk first.

We are located in and around rooms 251A, 257, 258, and 258A.

#### UC Berkeley

When on the UC Berkeley campus, we are currently located in Stanley
Hall, room 381. The site is about ten minutes from highway 80 by car and
ten minutes from the downtown Berkeley BART station by shuttle.

Parking near campus can be difficult or impossible. There is parking
available for guests on the LBNL campus up the hill from UC
Berkeley. Please let us know ahead of time if you want to park there, so that someone in the group can make
arrangements to make sure that you have a visitor's pass waiting at
the main gate of LBL. We recommend LBL Lot E for BBOP visitors to
Stanley Hall.
