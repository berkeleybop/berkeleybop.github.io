The NMDC aims to enable the microbiome research community to decode the molecular underpinnings of fundamental biological processes, and ultimately, drive transformational discoveries.
Chris Mungall is one of the Aim 1 leads, overseeing the application of existing ontology mapping tools and curation resources to automate annotation of metadata to comply with FAIR principles.
