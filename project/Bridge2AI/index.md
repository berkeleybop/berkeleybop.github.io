**Bridge2AI Standards Core**

The overall goal of the NIH Common Fundâ€™s [Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI)](https://bridge2ai.org/) program is
to generate flagship datasets and best practices for the collection and preparation of data to address
biomedical research grand challenges that require artificial intelligence and machine-learning (AI/ML) analysis.

As part of the Standards Core, our mission is to develop software and standards to unify data attributes across 
multiple Bridge2AI Data Generation Projects and a wide range of data types.
We will engage with the community to extend existing standards and design new ones in the areas of data modeling, ontologies, data exchange formats,
data quality evaluation, data mapping and harmonization, knowledge graphs, standards-driven tools (including tools that facilitate graph-based machine learning),
provenance and attribution. Whenever possible, we will encode standards using our
[LinkML modeling framework](https://linkml.io/), which provides easy-to-use structures for data scientists and data engineers while retaining semantic linkages.
