Apollo is a browser-based tool for visualization and editing of sequence annotations. It is designed for distributed community annotation efforts, where numerous people may be working on the same sequences in geographically different locations; real-time updating keeps all users in sync during the editing process.

Apollo was originally developed as a collaboration between the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (part of the FlyBase consortium) and The Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK. It was used by the FlyBase biologists to construct the Release 3 and 4 annotations on the finished Drosophila melanogaster genome, and has also beena primary vehicle for sharing these annotations with the community.
Apollo allows researchers to explore genomic annotations at many levels of detail, and to perform expert annotation curation, all in a graphical environment.
