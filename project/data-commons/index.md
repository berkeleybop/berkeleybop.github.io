The BioData Catalyst project (originally called DataSTAGE, with a pilot project called Data Commons) aims to collaboratively solve technical challenges to enable NHLBI investigators to find, access, share, store, cross-link, and compute on large-scale data sets.
For NHLBI research investigators who need to find, access, share, store, cross-link, and compute on large scale data sets, NHLBI BioData Catalyst will serve as a cloud-based platform providing tools, applications, and workflows to enable these capabilities in secure workspaces. By making biomedical data sets accessible to varied users, BioData Catalyst will drive discovery and scientific advancement, leading to novel diagnostic tools, therapeutic options, and prevention strategies for heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders.
Our roles in the project relate to ontology development, standards, APIs, and data harmonization.
