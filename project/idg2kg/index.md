"Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs" (IDG2KG), funded by the NIH as part of the [Illuminating the Druggable Genome](https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg) effort, builds on leading computational resources in biomedicine (including the Monarch Initiative, which is co-led by BBOP PI Chris Mungall) to create a knowledgebase about drugs, proteins and diseases.
We use machine learning (ML) approaches to learn disease-protein associations, paving the way to forming hypotheses about how to treat diseases. Prioritizing novel drug targets is a slow, high-risk process; the IDK2KG project aims to accelerate this critical step in drug development.
