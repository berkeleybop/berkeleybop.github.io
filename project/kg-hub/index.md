KG-Hub is a platform that enables standardized construction, exchange, and reuse of knowledge graphs (KGs). 

KG-Hub includes:
- Design patterns and standards for building interoperable graphs based on the Biolink Model (https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/).
- Example KG projects (see https://kghub.io/).
- A set of OBO Foundry ontologies, ready to use in your own KG (see https://kghub.org/kg_obo/).
- The KG-Registry, a catalog of KG projects, their components, and their related tools (see https://kghub.org/kg-registry/).
