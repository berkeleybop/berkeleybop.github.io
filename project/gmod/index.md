The Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project is a collection of open source software tools for managing, visualising, storing, and disseminating genetic and genomic data.

GMOD is still active, but BBOP is no longer actively involved in it.

GMOD software projects our team previously contributed to:

- [Apollo](https://genomearchitect.org): A web-based genome annotation browser and editor based on JBrowse
- [Chado](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado): Chado is a relational schema that underlies many GMOD installations
- [JBrowse](http://jbrowse.org): A genomic web browser package used by Apollo and many other projects
