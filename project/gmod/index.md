The Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project is a collection of open source software tools for managing, visualising, storing, and disseminating genetic and genomic data.

Some of the many GMOD software projects we collaborate with / contribute to:

- [Apollo](https://genomearchitect.org): A Java-based genome annotation browser and editor
- [Chado](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado): Chado is a relational schema that underlies many GMOD installations
- [JBrowse](http://jbrowse.org): A genomic web browser package used by Apollo and many other projects
