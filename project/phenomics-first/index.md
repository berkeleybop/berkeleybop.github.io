# A phenomics-first resource for interpretation of variants

The human genome has been sequenced, and yet so much is unknown about what it does; what we do know is scattered across multiple, heterogeneous data sources that are difficult to integrate.
The Phenomics First Center of Excellence coordinates the efforts of a large community of researchers and clinicians to help decode how the differences (variants) in a patientâ€™s genome and their physical characteristics (phenotypes).
To accomplish this, we are developing tools to modernize how biomedical information about genetic conditions is captured, stored, and exchanged.

Phenomics First ([press release](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/2020/10/08/phenomics-first-project-receives-10m-to-unite-genetic-disease-data/))
is one of a number of efforts driven by the [Monarch Initiative](http://monarchinitiative.org),
which seeks to integrate the world's gene-to-phenotype-to-disease knowledge in a comprehensive knowledge graph to aid variant prioritization and ultimately clinical diagnostics. 
An important pillar of this work is the unification of phenotype ontologies using community- and pattern-driven ontology development.
The ultimate goal is a deeply integrated Unified Phenotype Ontology ([uPheno](https://ols.monarchinitiative.org/ontologies/upheno2))
that enables applications such as cross-species phenotype matching, phenotypic profile matching for disease diagnostics and improved variant prioritization.
Part of the strategy for ontology merging and mapping involves an effort to establish a 
Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings ([SSSOM](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/SSSOM/blob/master/SSSOM.md)).

Phenomics First will gather and unify the data from numerous sources to advance genomic interpretation in clinical settings, and will
help both researchers and clinicians to overcome long-standing barriers to discovery and patient care.
