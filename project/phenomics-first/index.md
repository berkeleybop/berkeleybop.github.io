# A phenomics-first resource for interpretation of variants

The human genome has been sequenced, and yet so much is unknown about what it does; what we do know is scattered across multiple, heterogeneous data sources that are difficult to integrate.
The Phenomics First Resource (PFR) coordinates the efforts of a large community of researchers and clinicians to help interpret the relationship between the differences (called variants) in a patientâ€™s genome and their physical characteristics (phenotypes).
The PFR will gather and unify the data from numerous sources to advance genomic interpretation in clinical settings, and will empower both researchers and clinicians to overcome long-standing barriers to discovery and patient care.
