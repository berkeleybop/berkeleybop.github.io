The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry is a collective of
ontology developers and users committed to collaboration and shared
standards. We aim to build a suite of integrated ontologies that are:

 * Logically well formed
 * Scientifically accurate
 * Interoperable and interconnected
 * Non-overlapping

More details can be found on the [OBO Homepage](http://obofoundry.org/).

## History

Back in 2002, Michael Ashburner and Suzanna Lewis initiated this grass-roots effort. The goal of [OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org/) is to work with the community to create a suite of interoperable reference ontologies in the biomedical domain. We organize small content-development workshops to assist groups who have need of an ontology to support their research, such as anatomies, cell types, environments, and so on. From August 2005-2008 these workshops were supported through our 3-year collaboration with the [National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO)](http://bioontology.org/).

## Our Role

BBOP currently hosts the [OBO Foundry website](http://www.obofoundry.org/) and associated tools as a free service, such as nightly production of alternate ontology formats.

We perform continuous integration on a number of ontologies: http://build.berkeleybop.org

We are also involved in a number of ontology development efforts, such as:

- [GO](http://www.geneontology.org/): The Gene Ontology (see our [Gene Ontology project page](/project/gene-ontology/))
- [RO](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro/): OBO Relations Ontology
- [Uberon](http://uberon.org): Uberon cross-species ontology covering anatomical structures in animals
- [EnvO](http://environmentontology.org/): Environmental Ontology
- [PATO](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato): OBO Phenotype Quality Ontology

See also the [Monarch project page](/project/monarch/) for more ontologies that our group is involved in through the Monarch Initiative.

## Blog

This [OBO Foundry blog](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/) offers tips and examples for working with ontologies and ontology-related tools.
