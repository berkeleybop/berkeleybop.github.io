The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry is a collaborative experiment: to produce well-structured vocabularies for shared use across different biological and medical domains. The OBO Foundry introduces a new paradigm for biomedical ontology development by the establishment of gold standard reference ontologies for individual domains of inquiry.

Back in 2002 Michael Ashburner and Suzanna Lewis initiated this grass-roots effort. The goal of [OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org/) is to work with the community to create a suite of interoperable reference ontologies in the biomedical domain. We organize small content-development workshops to assist groups who have need of an ontology to support their research, such as anatomies, cell types, environments, and so on. From August 2005-2008 these workshops were supported through our 3-year collaboration with the [National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO)](http://bioontology.org/).

## Software & Resources: 
BBOP currently hosts the [OBO foundry website](http://www.obofoundry.org/) and associated tools as a free service, such as nightly production of alternate ontology formats.

We are also involved in a number of ontology development efforts, such as:

- [CARO](http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/CARO:Main_Page): Common Anatomy Reference Ontology
- [EnvO](http://www.envoc.org/): Environmental Conditions Ontology
- [GO](http://www.geneontology.org/): The Gene Ontology (see above)
- [OBI](http://obi.sourceforge.net/index.php): Ontologies for Biomedical Investigation
- [PATO](http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/PATO:Main_Page): OBO Phenotype Quality Ontology
- [OBO_REL](http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/): OBO Relations Ontology (see above)
