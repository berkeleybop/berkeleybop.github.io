**Center for Cancer Data Harmonization (CCDH)**

The NCIâ€™s Center for Cancer Data Harmonization (CCDH) aims to create a national cancer data ecosystem that will enable all participants across the cancer research and care continuum
to contribute, access, combine and analyze diverse data to facilitate new discoveries and lead to lowering the burden of cancer in our country.

The goal of CCDH is to facilitate harmonization and assure interoperability of data across the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) repositories and data coordinating centers.
