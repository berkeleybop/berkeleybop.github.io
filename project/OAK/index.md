# Ontology Access Kit (OAK)

OAK is a Python library for executing common ontology operations over a variety of backends.

It provides a collection of [interfaces](https://incatools.github.io/ontology-access-kit/interfaces/index.html) for various ontology operations, including:

 - [look up basic features](https://incatools.github.io/ontology-access-kit/interfaces/basic.html) of an ontology element, such as its label, definition, relationships, or aliases
 - search an ontology for a term
 - validate an ontology
 - modify or delete terms
 - generate and visualize subgraphs
 - perform more advanced operations, such as graph traversal, OWL axiom processing, or text annotation

For examples and more information, please refer to the [OAK documentation](https://incatools.github.io/ontology-access-kit/).
