Overview: 

AmiGO is the official tool for searching and browsing the Gene Ontology database. It allows you to explore a controlled vocabulary of terms covering biological concepts, and a large number of genes or gene products whose attributes have been annotated using GO terms.

Using AmiGO, you can:

    Search for a gene or gene product, or a list of gene or gene products, and view the GO term associations
    Perform a sequence identity BLAST search and view the GO term associations for the genes or proteins returned
    Search for GO terms and view the genes or gene products they are annotated to
    Browse the GO ontology and view terms
