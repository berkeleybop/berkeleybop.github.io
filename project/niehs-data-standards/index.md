# Data Standards to Support Integrated Source to Outcome Modeling

To make progress in Environmental Health Sciences (EHS) research, it's important to have standardized ways of describing data, methods, and knowledge to help researchers in different EHS subfields
understand each other's work and share information more easily.
We propose to create common standards for describing EHS data and to build a system that can integrate data from many different subfields.
Specifically, we plan to integrate data on chemicals in the environment with models predicting the effects of human exposure to these chemicals. 
The Mungall groupsâ€™s role will be to expand our [Biolink Model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/) to cover the entire EHS field,
including how chemicals move through the environment and how they can play a role in human health.
